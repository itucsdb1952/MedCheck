Finally you can make an appointment. Here information you entered does not have to be same with the information you provided while signing into the system. Meaning that you may live in Uskudar but you can make reservation to hospital in Kadikoy. Important thing in here is you should be careful about your appointment date. Since this platforms makes it easy to make appointment, not being present at the appointment time will impact negatively your future appointment requests.
